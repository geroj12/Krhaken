#### Description:
> Kr'haken is a fast paced 2d topdown action game, in a sunken temple, where you play as a cursed treasure hunter, on their struggle to escape.
With your crystal magic powers and your hook, you move around the map, trying to avoid enemy attacks, and kill them for a chance to open the portal to freedom.
The Player is a female pirat. She got cursed when looting an unholy treasure of the Kr'haken.
She transformed into a manta-like monster and got magic powers.
Now she has to escape the dungeon of the Kr'haken by slaying the roaming monsters and collecting their souls
So hopefully she can sacrifice those souls at the altar to open the portal and flee her fate.
